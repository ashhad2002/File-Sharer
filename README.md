# File-Sharer
Application for sharing files. You can upload and then download those images using mongodb from the server, upon which said files are sent to the client side for downloading. Interface could use some work, but the application is functional. I plan to continue working on this when I have time. 

You need to create a .env file, containing a FILE_DB_URI, which will link to your mongodb database.
